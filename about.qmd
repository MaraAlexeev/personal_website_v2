# Who am I?

My name is Mara Alexeev. I currently live in Athens, Georgia, but I grew up on a farm in central Iowa. In fourth grade I was in love with space and wanted to be a part time astronaut and part time farmer.

In the summer of 2022, I finished a masters in Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School and a fellowship in Clinical Informatics at Boston Children's Hospital. My primary medical specialty is Pediatrics.

Currently, I am the Director of Clinical Informatics at a health tech start up called Layer Health.

I love learning human and computer languages. Iâ€™ve had a long love affair with Russian and German, and interested in American Sign Language (and also the Russian Manual Alphabet!), and casually learning a bit of Latin and Spanish.

At home you can find me reading, cooking, in the garden, and chasing my children around.
