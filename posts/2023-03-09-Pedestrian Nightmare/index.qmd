# Big parenting fears

One of my biggest fears as a parent is the threat of cars to the well-being of my children. And unlike other lurking parenting fears, this one is upsetting because it is a fairly rational fear based on the causes of death and injury to children in and out of vehicles.

I hope to learn a bit more about how my own community could make streets safer and better for folks, so putting this here as a promise to myself.
