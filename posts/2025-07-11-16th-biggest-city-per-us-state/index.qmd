# Marshalltown, Iowa

[Marshalltown, Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalltown,_Iowa) is a city in Central Iowa that is probably best known for things you might see in the stores like Lowe's and Home Depot: Lennox and the Marshalltown Company. Lennox makes all sorts of AC and heating applicances, and the Marshalltown Company, which makes an incredible number of specialized tools used in everything from tiling your bathroom to archaeological expeditions. I think many of these big "handyman" stores will have part of an aisle dedicated to these tools. In a story that feels like it could have only ever happened in 19th century America, a single man and local blacksmith, [David Lennox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Lennox), was a pivotal person in both companies.

I grew up near Marshalltown, and I attended school in Marshalltown until leaving for college in 2004. A friend from medical school messaged me today to tell me that she happened upon the trivia that Marshalltown is the 16th largest city in Iowa. I didn't know how to put in that in perspective. I guess that it is probably still under 30,000 people. It seems to be growing slightly when I go visit my parents, and I feel like it was in the 25,000 range when I moved away 21(!) years ago. 

# Census Bureau

So I had to head over to the [Census Bureau's website](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/) to see what the 16th largest cities in other states look like around the United States. 

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(crosstalk)
library(DT)
```
```{r}
#| label: read-from-local-file

# The path to the local data file
# The file is in a subfolder called "data"
file_path <- "data/sub-est2024.csv"

# Read the data from the CSV file
# The 'tryCatch' block will show a helpful message if the file is not found.
local_data <- tryCatch({
  # Explicitly set the SUMLEV column to be read as character to preserve leading zeros
  # Added locale to handle "invalid UTF-8" warnings by specifying the file encoding.
  read_csv(file_path, 
           col_types = cols(SUMLEV = col_character()),
           locale = locale(encoding = "latin1"))
}, error = function(e) {
  message("Error reading file: ", e$message)
  message("\nPlease make sure '", file_path, "' exists and is a valid CSV file.")
  # Return an empty tibble or NULL if the file can't be read
  tibble() 
})


```
```{r}
 local_data <- local_data %>%
    mutate(
      sumlev_desc = case_when(
        SUMLEV == "040" ~ "State",
        SUMLEV == "050" ~ "County",
        SUMLEV == "061" ~ "Minor Civil Division",
        SUMLEV == "071" ~ "Minor Civil Division place part",
        SUMLEV == "157" ~ "County place part",
        SUMLEV == "162" ~ "Incorporated place",
        SUMLEV == "170" ~ "Consolidated city",
        SUMLEV == "172" ~ "Consolidated city -- place within consolidated city",
        TRUE ~ "Other" # A default for any values not in the key
      )
    )
```


But before we get to granular level data, let's just look at the state level. Who is #16???

```{r}
  ranked_states <- local_data %>%
    filter(SUMLEV == "040") %>%
    arrange(desc(ESTIMATESBASE2020)) %>%
    mutate(Rank = row_number()) %>%
    select(Rank, STNAME, ESTIMATESBASE2020)

  # Assign the 16th ranked state name to a variable
  state_16 <- ranked_states$STNAME[16]

  # Display the table
  knitr::kable(
    ranked_states,
    caption = "State Population for 2020 Census, in Descending Order",
    col.names = c("Rank", "State Name", "2020 Population Base"),
    format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
```

So our 16th largest state is `r state_16`!

But let's see what the 16th largest "city" is in each state. I will need to get some better understanding of how the Census Bureau defines their cities to make sure I am filtering on the correct codes, but I want to get this out quickly for my curious friends! Marshalltown does come out as the 16th based on 2020 population estimates. 



```{r}
  ranked_cities_by_state_all <- local_data %>%
    distinct(STNAME, NAME, ESTIMATESBASE2020, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
    filter(SUMLEV %in% c( "162", "61", "50")) %>%
    group_by(STNAME) %>%
    arrange(desc(ESTIMATESBASE2020)) %>%
    mutate(Rank = row_number()) %>%
    filter(Rank == 16 ) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    select(STNAME, NAME, ESTIMATESBASE2020) %>%
    arrange(STNAME)

    ranked_cities_by_state_all %>%
      mutate(Order = row_number()) %>%
  relocate(Order) %>%
      
    knitr::kable(
    caption = "16th Largest City or Place by 2020 Population Within Each State order alphabetically by State Name",
    col.names = c("Order", "State Name", "Place Name", "2020 Census Population"),
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
  )
    
    ranked_cities_by_state_by_pop <-ranked_cities_by_state_all %>% 
      arrange(desc(ESTIMATESBASE2020)) %>% mutate(Order = row_number()) %>%
  relocate(Order) 
    

    knitr::kable(ranked_cities_by_state_by_pop ,
    caption = "16th Largest City or Place by 2020 Census Population Within Each State ordered by Population Size",
    col.names = c("Order", "State Name", "Place Name", "2020 Census Population"),
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
  )
    
    

```

Let's see what happened over the past 5 years in Iowa with the top 25 cities. Did Marshalltown hold on in 2024???
```{r}
 
  ranked_cities_by_iowa <- local_data %>%
  filter(STNAME == "Iowa") %>%
filter(SUMLEV %in% c( "162", "61", "50")) %>%
    arrange(desc(POPESTIMATE2024)) %>%
    mutate(Rank = row_number()) %>%
    filter(Rank <= 25 ) %>%
   
    select(
      NAME,
      Rank,
      ESTIMATESBASE2020,
    
      POPESTIMATE2021,
      POPESTIMATE2022,
      POPESTIMATE2023,
      POPESTIMATE2024
    ) %>%
  arrange(Rank) %>%
  
    knitr::kable(
      caption = "Population Data for Iowa",
       col.names = c("Place Name", "Rank", "2020 Pop. Est.", "2021 Pop. Est.", "2022 Pop. Est.", "2023 Pop. Est.", "2024 Pop. Est."),
      format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
    )

 ranked_cities_by_iowa
```


Waukeeeeeeee!! ðŸ˜ˆ

# Looking for the outliers

While I don't think I understand my data well enough!
```{r}
local_data %>%
    filter(SUMLEV %in% c("162", "61", "50")) %>%
    group_by(STNAME) %>%
    summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>% 
    arrange(Count) %>%
    knitr::kable(
      caption = "Count of Selected Places per State", 
      col.names = c("State Name", "Selected Places")
    )
```

Check out Hawaii, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island below. My filtering above is not capturing what I believe reality is, or rather what typical non-Census Bureau people think about what should be on that list. I suspect I am filtering a variable called `SUMLEV` incorrectly or incorrectly __for some states__, which might have special ways they show up in the data.

```{r}
#| label: interactive-city-table
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
if (nrow(local_data) > 0) {
  # Prepare the data: Top 25 cities/places within each state
  top_25_cities <- local_data %>%
#    filter(SUMLEV %in% c("162", "170", "172")) %>%
    filter(SUMLEV %in% c( "162", "61", "50")) %>%
    group_by(STNAME) %>%
    arrange(desc(POPESTIMATE2020)) %>%
    mutate(Rank = row_number()) %>%
    filter(Rank <= 25) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    select(
      `State` = STNAME,
      `Rank` = Rank,
      `Place Name` = NAME,
      `2020 Population Estimate` = POPESTIMATE2020
    )

  # Create a shared data object for crosstalk
  shared_cities <- crosstalk::SharedData$new(top_25_cities)

  # Create the interactive UI using bscols for a sidebar layout
  crosstalk::bscols(
    widths = c(3, 9),
    crosstalk::filter_select(
      id = "state_filter",
      label = "Select a State:",
      sharedData = shared_cities,
      group = ~State
    ),
    DT::datatable(
      shared_cities,
      caption = "Top 25 Cities and Places per State by Population for 2020 Census Data",
      options = list(pageLength = 25, lengthMenu = c(10, 25, 50)),
      class = "cell-border stripe",
      rownames = FALSE
    ) %>%
      DT::formatRound(columns = "2020 Population Estimate", digits = 0, mark = ",")
  )
} else {
  "Data could not be loaded."
}
