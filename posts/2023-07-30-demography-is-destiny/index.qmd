# Family changes in one generation

From a very personal perspective I have noticed many interesting things about how family structures are changing and am wondering how much these changes are local to me or specific to my family or social circles. 

Doing a count (supported by my brother the family history buff) I come up that I had 33 first cousins. My children have 4. This seems like an insane contraction. Also, I grew up near many cousins and grandmothers. My children even don't live in the same time zone as their cousins. 

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

family_members <- read_csv("family_members.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

My family by the numbers!

```{r}
size_moms_fam <- 6
with_kids_mom <- 6

size_dads_fam <- 9
with_kids_dad <- 7

paternal_fist_cousins <- 20
maternal_first_cousins <- 21

first_cousins_with_kids_mom <- 21 - 5
first_cousins_with_kids_dad <- 20 - 7

first_cousin_offspring_mom <- 45
first_cousin_offspring_dad <- 23
```

```{r}
with_kids <- tibble( cohort = c("Gen 1", "Gen 1", "Gen 2", "Gen 2"), percent_with_kids = c((6/6), (7/9), ((21-5)/21), ((20-7)/20)), side = c("maternal", "paternal", "maternal", "paternal"))


```

```{r}
with_kids |> ggplot(aes(x = cohort, y = percent_with_kids, fill = side)) + geom_col() + facet_grid(.~side) + theme(legend.position = "none")
```


```{r}
kid_count <- tibble( generation = c(-1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1), 
                     kids = c( 6, 9, 21, 20, 45, 23), 
                     ave_family_size = c(6, 9, 21/6, 20/9, 45/21, 23/20),
                     side = c("maternal", "paternal", "maternal", "paternal", "maternal", "paternal"))
```

```{r}
kid_count |> ggplot(aes(x = generation, y = ave_family_size, fill = side)) + geom_col() + facet_grid(.~side) + theme(legend.position = "none")
```
