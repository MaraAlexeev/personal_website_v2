# Introduction

I am tired of bad or no meals. I am tried of scraps. I am tired of throwing food out. I am tired of thinking about food that isn't a fun meal. I love organization. I love big meal days like Thanksgiving, but the grinding routine of cooking most days for just my family and two very picky eaters is frustrating. 

My primary goals are to feed my family healthy food, cooked at home, with minimal fuss and less weekly planning.

Secondary goals are to have less food waste, fewer meals out, have a system that accommodates schedule flexibility, and can easily be adapted if I come to dread a dish.

Tertiary goals include eating more seasonal food, to try the occasional new dish, and coordinate meals that share common ingredients over the week to make less waste.

Idea one: 
Make a list of standard recipes. 
Get them all in Paprika (my recipe storage system)
Get a template in google sheets up for weekly planning
Share via blog!
