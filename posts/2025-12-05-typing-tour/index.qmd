# Inspiration

I want to teach my son to touch type. I also want to control the content that he types and keep it as a local project on our home computer. 

Here's my first attempt assisted by Gemini on 2025-12-04. It felt great for a quick version 1. I think it took about 20 minutes to create. In fact, I spent more time troubleshooting my quarto website workflow to display it than I did creating it. (Problem solved by closing RStudio and re-opening my project.)

<iframe width="780" height="1000" src="typing_tour.html" title="Typing tour version 1"></iframe>
```

# Next steps

- Create a less monolithic file structure. I want to be able to create different practice passages for him to practice. 

- Have a more comprehensive set of lessons that teach the different strokes.

- Create lessons that focus more on real words rather than bizarre strings. 

- Create combo grammar and typing lessons where you have to fix the grammar or spelling to complete the lesson.
