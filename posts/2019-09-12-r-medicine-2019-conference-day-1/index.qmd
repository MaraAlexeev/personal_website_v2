# Pets not Livestock

Alison Horst advised us that if our figures are more like pets than livestock, we should name them!!!

Here's my attempt to name some figures and link them throughout the document. 

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r simple bar graph}
bar_graph_mtcars <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = drv)) + geom_bar()
```
