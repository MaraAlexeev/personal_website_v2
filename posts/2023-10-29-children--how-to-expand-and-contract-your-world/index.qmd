# Park bench musings

A friend asked me on a beautiful October afternoon, how having children had changed what I care about in the world. Had it narrowed my sphere of interest? (Wish I could remember the original wording of the question, which was much better than that.)

# How children have changed me

# THoughts

Of me there is one major way in which children have changed my world: I care way more about what happens and I 

First, children

Preparing my children by keeping them safe and making them strong

Constantly considering how something (policy, law, event) will affect my children

Observing what others do to learn what I can to be a better mother

Noticed the different roles my husband and I play in the lives of our children

Understood the most important relationship in the world is the one I have with my husband

Feels like life was a spectator sport versus playing the game, and you don't know what the rules are or if you are going to be successful

Many things feel much more in focus, and many things just don't even reach the level of concern, they are surely noticed

I have never known a person like I have known my children, from before they were born noticing how they reacted to loud noises, to how busy they were to watching their personalities reveal themselves to me. To see how they interact with each other. TO understand how hunger and tiredness affect a mood. Knowing a person before they have the capacity to lie or effectively conceal their emotions is a wild ride. 

I'd not known exhaustion until I had children. 

Simple things are still simple but they are different. Apartment searching: clear goal is to have a place that is good for the children: quiet so they can sleep well, go to place, near school and parks, safe. Never does the idea of is this a hip place to enter into the equation. Needs for the adults are easily prioritized into how they allow us to serve the children. Eg a commute is important but after meeting basic standards for adult needs these aspects don't contribute more to 'fitness' of the apartment and only improvements for the children count. 

I think a lot about my own parents, the things they did great and the things that I will do differently.

I love my children so much, I think a lot about how to let them carve their own path but how to stay close to them in the future.

I find traveling away from my children physically painful.

More interested in the world than ever before. Want to know as much as I can and share it with them. Allow them to learn faster than it took me so they can exceed me in every way possible.

I love explaining and teaching them things. I love seeing the world afresh from their questions: why does it rain? why do plants need dirt? 

You get to ask yourself interesting questions too: why does my super tired baby not want to go to sleep?

Forgiveness: your young children do things that are terrible and selfish and mean. But my goal is to get them to a better state, which means loving them, being calm externally when you are screaming inside.

While I personally went into marriage feeling like divorce wasn't really an option I was willing to have on the table and my belief in that hasn't only strengthened over the years of marriage, there is no such option with children. You can't walk away from children. They are your children forever. And not that the words you say and things you do don't matter with other relationships, the history you share with your children isn't something you get to revise. Your son is only 5 years old for a brief moment and the impressions and expectations you set at different important times will follow you your whole life. 

You weakness and failings with them lays bare so many of your own deficiencies and short comings. 

Having more than one child is an amazing experience for us. To see how alike they are and their stark differences. I see much of my husband in the boys, and I suppose others have an easier time to see the similarities between the boys and me than it is for me to see them. 

Teaching my son to read has been one of the best experiences of my life. It feels like his brain was meant to read. His younger brother seems even more prepared to read given his exposure to his older brother. 

Self care has a bad rap sheet, but nothing has stood out to me as something you do so unintentionally, and often poorly, before you have children. Then you find yourself in the slough of young children and babies with very little spare time, not much spare energy, and the desperate need to take care of your body and mind. It will give you pause to think back to lazy weekends that you didn't manage to clean the kitchen until 10 pm on Sunday and thought 'Oops, can't believe I didn't make it to the gym this weekend'. 

Routine is the most powerful sanity tool you can imagine. It's good for you, it's good for kids, it's good for your marriage, and your finances.

Having children made me feel love in unimaginable ways. Also, makes you vulnerable in ways that can be frightening. Seeing my first son for the first time, felt like my body had been punched through to a new layer of reality where you don't understand the physics of it. Love was now a physical ache for this little red baby. The first night was excuriating because I could barely stop looking at him. I didn't want blink. The freshness of that first night doesn't last forever, but it did leave an undullable impression upon me. With my second son, I was pulled into that freshness again but the world was known to me. With the second one, the anticipation of the explosion of love was fantastic. I had a scheduled c-section for my second son, and the moments before the procedure were akin to a spiritual epiphany. I remember feeling euphoric (not a known side effect of spinal anesthesia to my knowledge!) and my heart bursting with the anticipation of meeting my child in a few moments. 

You've likely heard the saying that having children means that part of your heart leaves your body and walks in the world. It's fairly accurate
