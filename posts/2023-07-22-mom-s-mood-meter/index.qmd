# Tracking happiness, stress, and tiredness

In May 2018, I started tracking on a daily basis four variables once per day: discomfort, happiness, stress, and tiredness. I typically do the rating before bed as I journal.

I rate my status on these variables on a minus two to plus two scale. All variables have the same direction of 'goodness'. For example, plus two on the tiredness scale means I feel completely rested and have more than enough energy to do everything I wanted in a day, whereas minus two means I feel like I don't have enough energy to do the minimum amount of things needed to scrap by in a day. Plus two on the discomfort scale means my body feels amazing and I have no discomfort.

I have plotted the 28 day rolling mean of the value ratings below.

As I write this blog, I am fairly shocked by a few parts of the plot. First, I do not remember feeling so happy or rested as the plot seems to indicate after the birth of my first child (June 2018). Also it seems a two week break in July 2022 from work outside the home had huge effect on all four variables for a fair amount of time afterwards. I plan to investigate what happened in Spring 2019 that was temporally related to a significant downward shift of all ratings. Without referring back to my journal, I recall that Spring being highly influenced by trying to re-enter the workforce.

Some notable events are denoted with vertical lines on the plot:

- June 2018: birth of first child
- Sept 2019: return to work
- March 2020: living apart from husband and son during pandemic for approximately 100 days
- July 2020: start of fellowship
- August 2020: birth of second child
- July 2022: start of new job

I think the most exciting part of finally seeing this data is now planning to try a few different interventions on myself for 4 week periods to see if I can see meaningful changes to my rolling mean in any of the four areas.

An aspect not well captured in these plots is my sense of meaning. I have a tremendous sense of meaning in my life since having children. While that might seem like an improvement, I want even more! The kicks just keep getting harder to get, and now I crave more meaning in my life: more engagement with friends, family, my local community. It's as if my children unlocked a new level of connection to the world and expanded my capacity to care about things I hadn't even noticed in my life before. 

```{r}
#plot_interactive <- plot |> plotly::ggplotly()

plot_base + theme(legend.position = "none")



```
```{r}
data_combined <- data_mood |>
  select(timestamp, tiredness, stress, happiness, how_do_i_physically_feel) |>
  rename(discomfort = how_do_i_physically_feel) |>
  drop_na()

data_combined <- data_combined  |> 
  pivot_longer(!timestamp, names_to = 'measurement_type', values_to = 'value') 


data_combined$timestamp <- lubridate::as_datetime(data_combined$timestamp)

data_combined <- data_combined |> 

   mutate( value_norm =
    case_when(
    value == 0 ~ -2,
    value == 1 ~ -1,
    value == 2 ~ 0, 
    value == 3 ~ 1,
    value == 4 ~ 2
  )) |>
  select(timestamp, measurement_type, value_norm)|>
  group_by(timestamp) |>
   mutate(sum_ratings = sum(value_norm)) |>
  ungroup()|>
  select(timestamp, sum_ratings) |>
  distinct() |>
  mutate(rolling_mean_combined = zoo::rollmean(sum_ratings, 28, na.pad = TRUE)) |>
  drop_na()

```

# Combining it all

I think the combination of discomfort, happiness, stress, and tiredness are some of the biggest indicators of what my overall mood would probably be. When I look at the four measures summed up, I see following trends. I remain impressed that the year after my first child was born, I was rating myself so highly in all four areas.

```{r}
plot_sum <- ggplot(data_combined, aes(x = as_date(timestamp), y = rolling_mean_combined)) +

    breaks = scales::breaks_width("3 months"), 
    labels = scales::label_date_short()
  ) +

  
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Rating", title = "Mara's Mood (Combined Ratings) Over Time")  +
  
  geom_vline(
    xintercept =  lubridate::as_date('2018-06-09'),
    color = "blue",
