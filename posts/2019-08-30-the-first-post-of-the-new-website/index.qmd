*Note from March 2023: This post describes my migration from Squarespace to a blogdown website in August 2019. I migrated again in March 2023 from blogdown to a quarto website.* 

This is my first post on my new website built with the R package blogdown, the help of many online help pages, and my lovely husband. I am using Github and Netlify as well. I don't have the energy to write a post about how I built this, but here is the list of things that caused pain: 

* in my config.toml file I had replaced the baseurl default of `baseurl = "/"` with `baseurl = "https://www.maraalexeev.com"`
 * this causes problems so just keep it as the /

* on Netlify there is a deploy setting that I did incorrectly so my page worked locally but not online
 * Answer [here](https://community.netlify.com/t/common-issue-i-ve-deployed-my-site-but-i-still-see-page-not-found/125/2)
 
* somehow I got a post on my page from 1 AD (suspect no date was included on something), I renamed my file from a `foo.Rmarkdown` to `foo.Rmd` and the problem went away, but I can't be certain that I didn't also do something else in my quest.

Overall, this was an amazing but slightly frustrating experience with most of the frustration being at the deployment phase. Now that I have site up and running, I am beyond excited to start doing more with it. I especially am excited about figuring out how to have my data easily accessible for someone re-running my analysis in something that I post. 
 
A few quick things that I hope to do soon are: 

1. Understand more of what an R project means and how to use it in my workflow
2. Figure out how to store files and content in a reasonable method
3. Get amazing at Rmarkdown
4. Upload old content from my previous website
