    "text": "Who am I?\nMy name is Mara Alexeev. I currently live in Jersey City, New Jersey, but I grew up on a farm in central Iowa. In fourth grade I was in love with space and wanted to be a part time astronaut and part time farmer.\nIn the summer of 2022, I finished a masters in Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School and a fellowship in Clinical Informatics at Boston Children’s Hospital. My primary medical specialty is Pediatrics.\nCurrently, I am the Director of Clinical Informatics at a health tech start up called Dandelion Health.\nI love learning human and computer languages. I’ve had a long love affair with Russian and German, and recently became interested in American Sign Language (and also the Russian Manual Alphabet!) and thinking about learning Norwegian. On the computer front, I’m always learning more Python, R, and SQL. I enjoy data visualization and reproducible analysis and research.\nInterested in connecting or collaborating? Send me a message on Linkedin!\n\n\n\n\n\nMara at the Tandy, age 3"

    "text": "In the summer of 2020 we moved to Brookline, MA. Our routine immediately developed that we would do daycare drop off and then stop by Temptations Cafe (Hi Nassib!!) We particularly enjoyed their sticky buns, but it took us about 128 trips to the cafe on 108 dates to recognize the pattern of when sticky buns were available or not.\nHere I have made a github style waffle plot, that I believe makes the pattern of when sticky buns are available clearer. We finally noticed what the pattern was in October, when the days sticky buns were available increased.\nI copied the gh_waffle function from Matti Vuorre’s blog post with some minor modifications."

    "text": "I wanted to move away from my “original” blogdown method of blogging because I am really enthused about how great Quarto is. My blogdown project had accumulated so much code debris over the years because I started it when I was first learning to code, that it seemed easier to just take the posts and migrate them to a new Quarto Website + Blog than correcting all the mistakes accumulated over 4 years. I am initially going to post this on Github Pages, but once I have migrated content from my old site, I will reassign this repo to my Netlify account to deploy to my personalized domain.\nThree things I wanted out of the new website:\n\nMake writing posts easy. Quarto does not have an add-in (yet) like Blogdown does to create a new blog post. So I leaned very, very heavily on Mark Edney’s R-Blogger’s post on how to make a handy Shiny app to take the thinking out of setting up each blog post. The rough part of being just excited enough to blog, but with huge time constraints is that I might go months in between posting and inevitably forget things and it frustrates me.\nHave a website plus a blog so the Quarto Website + Blog was a great combo idea that I was able to execute with help from a post by Samantha Csik.\nEnable discussions on my blog. I don’t think I have much traffic on my blog, but I know a few people have used things I have written because when I was Googling myself I found someone thanking me in their blog post about something I had had to troubleshoot in my blog and of course then blogged about it. Last fall I saw a cool method called giscus, so will use that.\n\n\n\nFor setting up the Shiny App, the only major change I did was to make a multi-select option for categories for my blog post template from Mark’s original work. This is nice because it helps me make sure I am not duplicating categories (eg Medicine and medicine) because categories are case sensitive. I also added a data-modified section to my template because I like to capture when I update a post. Also, I love the YAML template including draft = 'true' to harder to accidentally post a draft version of your post.\nHere’s the whole app below.\n\n\nCode\n# Source https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/08/creating-posts-for-quarto-blog/\n#\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(miniUI)\n\nQGadget <- function() {....}\n\nui <- miniUI::miniPage(\n  miniUI::gadgetTitleBar(\"Quarto Blog Post\"),\n  miniUI::miniContentPanel(\n    shiny::textInput(\"title\", \"Title\", placeholder = \"Post Title\"),\n    shiny::selectInput(\"categories\", \"Categories\", \n                       choices = list(\"How-to\", \n                                      \"R\", \"Python\", \"Quarto\",\n                                      \"Medicine\", \n                                      \"Family Life\", \"Cooking\"),\n                       multiple = TRUE)\n\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  shiny::observeEvent(input$done, {\n    Blog_post(input$title, input$categories)\n    stopApp(\"Post Created\")\n  })\n}\n\nshiny::runGadget(ui, server, viewer = shiny::dialogViewer(\"Quarto Blog Post\"))\n\nBlog_post <- function(title, categories){\n  data <- list(title = title,\n               author = \"'Mara Alexeev'\",\n               date = Sys.Date(),\n               date_modified = \"'`r Sys.Date()`'\",\n               categories = categories,\n                 \n               draft = 'true',\n               description = \"''\",\n               image = \"''\",\n               archives = format(date, \"%Y/%m\"),\n               toc = 'false',\n               fold = \"true\",\n               tools = 'true',\n               link =  'false')\n  \n  Template <- '---\ntitle: {{title}}\nauthor: {{author}}\ndate: {{date}}\ndate-modified: {{date_modified}}\ncategories: [{{categories}}]\ndraft: {{draft}}\ndescription: {{description}}\nimage: {{image}}\narchives:\n  - {{archives}}\ntoc: {{toc}}\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: {{fold}}\n    code-tools: {{tools}}\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\n# Conclusion\n\n'\n  \n  dir.create(paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title))\n  writeLines(whisker::whisker.render(Template, data), paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title, \"/index.qmd\"))\n  file.edit(paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title, \"/index.qmd\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSamantha points out that a Quarto Blog is just a special point of a Quarto website. I actually got a little concerned about using Quarto as my blog because the directions of how to set up the individual posts had a lot of steps that I was worried I would not be able to do consistently over time. That’s when I thought to write a script to do it for me, and instead was saved several hours of work by Mark’s post.\n\n\n\nOkay, so this is the main thrust of this post: Giscus. Which has painfully cute name. I was actually able to set it up on a test Quarto Book project, but of course that was months ago, and I can’t remember the process because I didn’t write it down! So for myself and for everyone else, here I go!\nFirst, why did I choose giscus? I loved that it supported multiple languages (human languages because I sometimes blog about languages that don’t use the Latin alphabet), it has some math notation ability, and it is open source and has a great github page.\n\n\n\n\nYou have to add giscus as an app on Github.\nDepending on your settings, you additionally may need to add the repo of interest to you configuration settings on giscus.\nEnable discussions on your repo (settings -> features -> discussions).\nGo to giscus.app and follow instructions there and it will give you some good information like repo-id which you will need to put in your _quarto.yml.\nTake the information from the giscus.app and update your _quarto.yml to include information about the repo, giscus, and some ids. Unfortunately, it is not formatted the way you need to put it into the _quarto.yml.\n\n  comments: \n    giscus:\n      repo: MaraAlexeev/personal_website_v2\n      repo-id: FAKE_REPO_ID #Get this from giscus.app\n      category: General\n      category-id: FAKE_CATEGORY_ID #Get this from giscus.app\n      mapping: title #pathname was very gross format\n      reactions-enabled: TRUE\n      input-position: bottom\n      theme: light\n\nFor pages you don’t want to have comments on put in the yaml header of that page comments: false. I do this for my blog post listing page and my about page."
