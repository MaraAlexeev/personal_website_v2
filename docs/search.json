    "text": "Who am I?\nMy name is Mara Alexeev. I currently live in Jersey City, New Jersey, but I grew up on a farm in central Iowa. In fourth grade I was in love with space and wanted to be a part time astronaut and part time farmer.\nIn the summer of 2022, I finished a masters in Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School and a fellowship in Clinical Informatics at Boston Children’s Hospital. My primary medical specialty is Pediatrics.\nCurrently, I am the Director of Clinical Informatics at a health tech start up called Dandelion Health.\nI love learning human and computer languages. I’ve had a long love affair with Russian and German, and recently became interested in American Sign Language (and also the Russian Manual Alphabet!) and thinking about learning Norwegian. On the computer front, I’m always learning more Python, R, and SQL. I enjoy data visualization and reproducible analysis and research.\nInterested in connecting or collaborating? Send me a message on Linkedin!"

    "text": "In the summer of 2020 we moved to Brookline, MA. Our routine immediately developed that we would do daycare drop off and then stop by Temptations Cafe (Hi Nassib!!) We particularly enjoyed their sticky buns, but it took us about 128 trips to the cafe to understand the pattern of when sticky buns were available or not.\nHere I have made a github style waffle plot, that I believe makes the pattern of when sticky buns are available clearer. We finally noticed what the pattern was in October, when the days sticky buns were available increased."
