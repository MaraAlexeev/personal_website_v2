    "text": "Who am I?\nMy name is Mara Alexeev. I currently live in Jersey City, New Jersey, but I grew up on a farm in central Iowa. In fourth grade I was in love with space and wanted to be a part time astronaut and part time farmer.\nIn the summer of 2022, I finished a masters in Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School and a fellowship in Clinical Informatics at Boston Children’s Hospital. My primary medical specialty is Pediatrics.\nCurrently, I am the Director of Clinical Informatics at a health tech start up called Dandelion Health.\nI love learning human and computer languages. I’ve had a long love affair with Russian and German, and recently became interested in American Sign Language (and also the Russian Manual Alphabet!) and thinking about learning Norwegian. On the computer front, I’m always learning more Python, R, and SQL. I enjoy data visualization and reproducible analysis and research.\nInterested in connecting or collaborating? Send me a message on Linkedin!\n\n\n\n\n\nMara at the Tandy, age 3"

    "text": "The Prize\nI read The Prize by Daniel Yergin two plus years ago while in the haze of a new baby and starting a masters and doing a fellowship, so a book report written at that time would probably be a patchy effort at best. Thus a book report written two years later is most certainly entirely suspect. However, I loved the book, and I now recommend it to anyone who will let me get to the point in a conversation where we are talking books.\n\n\nSelected unpolished thoughts\n\nhow much energy enables our modern life\nhow much oil is a national security concern\nwhy oil geography is wrapped up in wars\nthat the Nazis and Japanese Empire lost WWII in part because of energy insufficiency\nhow amazing the logistics of oil refinement and distribution are\nhow the needs of the oil industry created the most complicated and capable organizations in the world because they had the thing everyone wanted everywhere and there was a ton of competition\noil is power, figuratively\nmaybe most people don’t understand at all how important oil is because I certainly didn’t before I read the book\nhow crazy the personalities were in the history of oil and how different strategies worked or did not work\nunderstanding nationalism more in the context of industrial ‘imperialism’\nimportance of human capital (an oil poor country like they Netherlands is a business powerhouse because it has talented people working on them problem) and knowledge infrastructure\nif some countries were able to get (and were not actively thwarted by external forces) themselves together they could be much better, bigger world players\nrelated to that, how delicate the policies and relationships can be between companies and the country they are operating in (eg Mexico getting angry and nationalizing the oil, but if that happens then no company will ever want to go there again and then they won’t be able to profit from their natural resources). Trump picking Rex Tiller as Secretary of State made much more sense after reading this book because I realized how much an Oil Company is like a country with little enclaves in many countries and assets in many (pipelines) and a non military “navy”.\nthe amazing pressure oil companies self imposed on themselves to decrease drilling and improve well conditions and the terrible conditions that were created by competing operators drilling too much into fields and causing the fields to fail prematurely because of destruction of the favorable conditions for extraction\nthe amazing technology that came out of the necessities of the oil industry\n\nQuestions I still don’t understand:\n\nwhy hydrocarbon companies aren’t leading the charge into nuclear energy?\nwho benefits from the public sentiment of “big bad oil” when literally everyone in the US is using their products in many parts of their lives\nwith the oil spills that have happened, is this a lot or is this not a lot (the process sounds completely terrifying) given the complexity of the process and inherent danger in a operation of such scale with hydrocarbons and involving so many natural factors (eg the oil field, ice bergs, hurricanes)\nwhy so many of the countries with this amazing resource are so poorly managed or have such repressive regimens (this is addressed but probably needs its own book!)\n\n\n\nFuture reading\nNext on my reading lists will be some of Yergin’s subsequent books. I will try to do better note take for future posts."

    "text": "Family visited recently and left us with nine cans of Icelandic Cod Liver. Why nine you ask? Well they had a box of twelve sent ahead of their visit and ate three of them while staying with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI texted a picture of my undeserved hepatic lode of Northern Atlantic goodness to med school friends and promised culinary updates in my pursuit of full turn over of the cupboard inventory. Well, it is just too good of a joke to not take seriously. The tin also is a bit inspirational with the brand name “iCan”.\nI’m not a spicy food fanatic, but other than that I am try to be game for trying something at least once.\nThe process of getting these fish livers to me in tidy little tins is probably worthy of its own write up, but alas we will have to settle with Mara reviewing the end product.\nACT I\nI opened the can up and it reminded me of cat food. Cat food I would be happy to feed to my hypothetical cat, but cat food nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first recipe was just the product of reviewing a few Google hits and synthesizing them into something that I had the ingredients for. Hard to even call it a recipe since it was so easy to do.\nCod liver on toast\n\nCan of cod liver, drained then mashed with fork\nTwo hard boiled eggs, sliced\nChopped chives, 1 teaspoon combined with cod liver, and 2 teaspoon reserved for garnish\nSqueeze of lemon juice into mashed cod liver\nToast, buttered\nSalt to taste\n\nTop toast with mashed cod liver. Add a slice of egg and top with chives. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview – Totally fine! Good even. And looked fancy. I think a high end butter would elevate it. I happened to have a fresh loaf of sourdough bread at home, and that was a very nice combo. Would consider serving this at a party like a Russian style New Year’s Eve party with lots of small appetizers. Probably would not eat a ton of these, but certainly an interesting dish with good texture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACT II-IX\nTo be continued…"

    "text": "In the summer of 2020 we moved to Brookline, MA. Our routine immediately developed that we would do daycare drop off and then stop by Temptations Cafe (Hi Nassib!!) We particularly enjoyed their sticky buns, but it took us about 128 trips to the cafe on 108 dates to recognize the pattern of when sticky buns were available or not.\nHere I have made a github style waffle plot, that I believe makes the pattern of when sticky buns are available clearer. We finally noticed what the pattern was in October, when the days sticky buns were available increased.\nI copied the gh_waffle function from Matti Vuorre’s blog post with some minor modifications."

    "text": "I wanted to move away from my “original” blogdown method of blogging because I am really enthused about how great Quarto is. My blogdown project had accumulated so much code debris over the years because I started it when I was first learning to code, that it seemed easier to just take the posts and migrate them to a new Quarto Website + Blog than correcting all the mistakes accumulated over 4 years. I am initially going to post this on Github Pages, but once I have migrated content from my old site, I will reassign this repo to my Netlify account to deploy to my personalized domain.\nThree things I wanted out of the new website:\n\nMake writing posts easy. Quarto does not have an add-in (yet) like Blogdown does to create a new blog post. So I leaned very, very heavily on Mark Edney’s R-Blogger’s post on how to make a handy Shiny app to take the thinking out of setting up each blog post. The rough part of being just excited enough to blog, but with huge time constraints is that I might go months in between posting and inevitably forget things and it frustrates me.\nHave a website plus a blog so the Quarto Website + Blog was a great combo idea that I was able to execute with help from a post by Samantha Csik.\nEnable discussions on my blog. I don’t think I have much traffic on my blog, but I know a few people have used things I have written because when I was Googling myself I found someone thanking me in their blog post about something I had had to troubleshoot in my blog and of course then blogged about it. Last fall I saw a cool method called giscus, so will use that.\n\n\n\nFor setting up the Shiny App, the only major change I did was to make a multi-select option for categories for my blog post template from Mark’s original work. This is nice because it helps me make sure I am not duplicating categories (eg Medicine and medicine) because categories are case sensitive. I also added a data-modified section to my template because I like to capture when I update a post. Also, I love the YAML template including draft = 'true' to harder to accidentally post a draft version of your post.\nHere’s the whole app below.\n\n\nCode\n# Source https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/08/creating-posts-for-quarto-blog/\n#\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(miniUI)\n\nQGadget <- function() {....}\n\nui <- miniUI::miniPage(\n  miniUI::gadgetTitleBar(\"Quarto Blog Post\"),\n  miniUI::miniContentPanel(\n    shiny::textInput(\"title\", \"Title\", placeholder = \"Post Title\"),\n    shiny::selectInput(\"categories\", \"Categories\", \n                       choices = list(\"How-to\", \n                                      \"R\", \"Python\", \"Quarto\",\n                                      \"Medicine\", \n                                      \"Family Life\", \"Cooking\"),\n                       multiple = TRUE)\n\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  shiny::observeEvent(input$done, {\n    Blog_post(input$title, input$categories)\n    stopApp(\"Post Created\")\n  })\n}\n\nshiny::runGadget(ui, server, viewer = shiny::dialogViewer(\"Quarto Blog Post\"))\n\nBlog_post <- function(title, categories){\n  data <- list(title = title,\n               author = \"'Mara Alexeev'\",\n               date = Sys.Date(),\n               date_modified = \"'`r Sys.Date()`'\",\n               categories = categories,\n                 \n               draft = 'true',\n               description = \"''\",\n               image = \"''\",\n               archives = format(date, \"%Y/%m\"),\n               toc = 'false',\n               fold = \"true\",\n               tools = 'true',\n               link =  'false')\n  \n  Template <- '---\ntitle: {{title}}\nauthor: {{author}}\ndate: {{date}}\ndate-modified: {{date_modified}}\ncategories: [{{categories}}]\ndraft: {{draft}}\ndescription: {{description}}\nimage: {{image}}\narchives:\n  - {{archives}}\ntoc: {{toc}}\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: {{fold}}\n    code-tools: {{tools}}\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\n# Conclusion\n\n'\n  \n  dir.create(paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title))\n  writeLines(whisker::whisker.render(Template, data), paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title, \"/index.qmd\"))\n  file.edit(paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title, \"/index.qmd\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSamantha points out that a Quarto Blog is just a special point of a Quarto website. I actually got a little concerned about using Quarto as my blog because the directions of how to set up the individual posts had a lot of steps that I was worried I would not be able to do consistently over time. That’s when I thought to write a script to do it for me, and instead was saved several hours of work by Mark’s post.\n\n\n\nOkay, so this is the main thrust of this post: Giscus. Which has painfully cute name. I was actually able to set it up on a test Quarto Book project, but of course that was months ago, and I can’t remember the process because I didn’t write it down! So for myself and for everyone else, here I go!\nFirst, why did I choose giscus? I loved that it supported multiple languages (human languages because I sometimes blog about languages that don’t use the Latin alphabet), it has some math notation ability, and it is open source and has a great github page.\n\n\n\n\nYou have to add giscus as an app on Github.\nDepending on your settings, you additionally may need to add the repo of interest to you configuration settings on giscus.\nEnable discussions on your repo (settings -> features -> discussions).\nGo to giscus.app and follow instructions there and it will give you some good information like repo-id which you will need to put in your _quarto.yml.\nTake the information from the giscus.app and update your _quarto.yml to include information about the repo, giscus, and some ids. Unfortunately, it is not formatted the way you need to put it into the _quarto.yml.\n\n  comments: \n    giscus:\n      repo: MaraAlexeev/personal_website_v2\n      repo-id: FAKE_REPO_ID #Get this from giscus.app\n      category: General\n      category-id: FAKE_CATEGORY_ID #Get this from giscus.app\n      mapping: title #pathname was very gross format\n      reactions-enabled: TRUE\n      input-position: bottom\n      theme: light\n\nFor pages you don’t want to have comments on put in the yaml header of that page comments: false. I do this for my blog post listing page and my about page."
