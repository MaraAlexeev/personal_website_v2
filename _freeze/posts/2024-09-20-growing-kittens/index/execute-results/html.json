I tracked their daily weights out of curiosity and because I while I really enjoy fostering kittens, I would like some good rule of thumb for expected weight gain to help plan life around fostering (eg: Is this likely a 2 week or more of 4 week fostering gig?) The Maui Humane Society had specific weight cut offs for when kittens could be neutered (910 grams or 2 lbs), so for kittens that are socialized and healthy, this weight goal is the last hurdle before their neutering and being put up for adoption. Sadly, I don't know how old the kittens were when we started fostering them, but I was able to find the foster request email from the shelter, and the director estimated the duration of fostering would be 4-5 weeks. Pretty amazing then that it only took 2 weeks, but maybe she just didn't have the data to make good predictions on how long it takes kittens to gain weight.\n\n## Import and tidy data\n\nThe libraries I have loaded are tidyverse, janitor, googlesheets4 (this was added to the updated blog post and code in 2024), and tools. I tried to figure out if their was a code chuck option to show the code, but not show the evaluation of it, but didn't find it. I'll need to search through R Markdown. **Update** found it. Looks like I need to set message to false.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\nlibrary(tools)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Read google sheets data into R\nkitten_weight_gain <- read_sheet('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x-Udhm5VkhSh0siWLtipbDZFAMs5Zp7TsTpnUlmz9Jg/edit?gid=0#gid=0')\n                                                                                        \n\n#names(kitten_weight_gain)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkitten_weight_gain <- clean_names(kitten_weight_gain)\n\ntidy_kittens <- pivot_longer(kitten_weight_gain, cols = 3:5, names_to = \"kitten_name\", values_to = \"weight_in_grams\") \n\ntidy_kittens <- tidy_kittens %>% separate(col = 4, into = c(\"kitten_name\", \"sex\"), sep = \"_\")\n\ntidy_kittens$sex <- as.factor(tidy_kittens$sex)\n\ntidy_kittens$scale <- as.factor(tidy_kittens$scale)\n\ntidy_kittens$date <- as.Date(tidy_kittens$date, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\ntidy_kittens$weight_in_grams <- as.numeric(tidy_kittens$weight_in_grams)\n\ntidy_kittens$kitten_name <- tools::toTitleCase(tidy_kittens$kitten_name)\n\n#head(tidy_kittens)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nOk now I have my data in a more tidy format. This is the first time I have used dpylr::pivot_longer. I first tried to use dpylr::spread but saw a little note that pivot_longer was the new kid in town. I thought it was great. Certainly was faster for me to use even though it was the first time reading through the documentation.\n\n## Weight gain, graphically\n\nI want to denote a few things in my graph: distinguish the two males from the female kitten, note that the first day's wieght was by a different scale. And I'd love to somehow squeeze a picture of the kitten into its key--but since I only have a few minutes before my toddler wakes up--basics first.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngraphic_kittens <- ggplot(tidy_kittens, aes(x = date, y = weight_in_grams, color = kitten_name, shape = sex)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Foster Kitten Weight Gain\", subtitle = \"Journey to adequate weight for neutering and adoption\") +\n  xlab(\" \") +\n  ylab(\"Weight in grams\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 day\", date_labels = \"%b-%d\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(color = \"Which kitten?\") +\n  labs(shape = \"Sex of kitten?\") \n  \n\n\nprint(graphic_kittens)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Next steps\n\nQuestions I have now after the first collection of data: \n\nDo males and females have different weight gain rates?\n\nDo any animal shelters moniter weight gain as an indicator of kitten well being like we have for infant/child growth curves as humans?\n\nWhat are the currently known determinants of weight gain in domestic kittens? Though these kittens were supposedly siblings, queens can have a single litter with multiple toms fathering kittens, so the kittens from a single litter might be more or less related.\n\n",
