My blogdown project had accumulated so much code debris over the years because I started it when I was first learning to code, that it seemed easier to just take the posts and migrate them to a new Quarto Website + Blog than correcting all the mistakes accumulated over 4 years.\n\nThree things I wanted out of the new website:\n\n1) Make writing posts easy. Quarto does not have an add-in (yet) like Blogdown does to create a new blog post. So I leaned very, very heavily on [Mark Edney's R-Blogger's post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/08/creating-posts-for-quarto-blog/) on how to make a handy Shiny app to take the thinking out of setting up each blog post. The rough part of being just excited enough to blog, but with huge time constraints is that I might go months in between posting and inevitably forget things and it frustrates me. \n\n2) Have a website plus a blog so the Quarto Website + Blog was a great combo idea that I was able to execute with help from [a post by Samantha Csik.](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/)\n\n3) Enable discussions on my blog. I don't think I have much traffic on my blog, but I know a few people have used things I have written because when I was Googling myself I found someone thanking me in their blog post about something I had had to troubleshoot in my blog and of course then blogged about it. I saw last fall a cool method called giscus.\n\n## Shiny App for Blog Post Creation\n\nFor setting up the Shiny App, the only major change I did was to make a multi-select option for categories for my blog post template from Mark's original work. This is nice because it helps me make sure I am not duplicating categories (eg Medicine and medicine) because categories are case sensitive. I also added a `data-modified` section to my template because I like to capture when I update a post. Also, I love the YAML template including `draft = 'true'` to harder to accidentally post a draft version of your post.\n\nHere's the whole app below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Source https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/08/creating-posts-for-quarto-blog/\n#\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(miniUI)\n\nQGadget <- function() {....}\n\nui <- miniUI::miniPage(\n  miniUI::gadgetTitleBar(\"Quarto Blog Post\"),\n  miniUI::miniContentPanel(\n    shiny::textInput(\"title\", \"Title\", placeholder = \"Post Title\"),\n    shiny::selectInput(\"categories\", \"Categories\", \n                       choices = list(\"How-to\", \n                                      \"R\", \"Python\", \"Quarto\",\n                                      \"Medicine\", \n                                      \"Family Life\", \"Cooking\"),\n                       multiple = TRUE)\n\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  shiny::observeEvent(input$done, {\n    Blog_post(input$title, input$categories)\n    stopApp(\"Post Created\")\n  })\n}\n\nshiny::runGadget(ui, server, viewer = shiny::dialogViewer(\"Quarto Blog Post\"))\n\nBlog_post <- function(title, categories){\n  data <- list(title = title,\n               author = \"'Mara Alexeev'\",\n               date = Sys.Date(),\n               date_modified = \"'`r Sys.Date()`'\",\n               categories = categories,\n                 \n               draft = 'true',\n               description = \"''\",\n               image = \"''\",\n               archives = format(date, \"%Y/%m\"),\n               toc = 'false',\n               fold = \"true\",\n               tools = 'true',\n               link =  'false')\n  \n  Template <- '---\ntitle: {{title}}\nauthor: {{author}}\ndate: {{date}}\ndate-modified: {{date_modified}}\ncategories: [{{categories}}]\ndraft: {{draft}}\ndescription: {{description}}\nimage: {{image}}\narchives:\n  - {{archives}}\ntoc: {{toc}}\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: {{fold}}\n    code-tools: {{tools}}\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\n# Conclusion\n\n'\n  \n  dir.create(paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title))\n  writeLines(whisker::whisker.render(Template, data), paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title, \"/index.qmd\"))\n  file.edit(paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title, \"/index.qmd\"))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Blog on a Quarto Website\n\nSamantha points out that a Quarto Blog is just a special point of a Quarto website. I actually got a little concerned about using Quarto as my blog because the directions of how to set up the individual posts had a lot of steps that I was worried I would not be able to do consistently over time. That's when I thought to write a script to do it for me, and instead was saved several hours of work by Mark's post.\n\n## giscus\n\nOkay, so this is the main thrust of this post: Giscus. Which has painfully cute name. I was actually able to set it up on a test Quarto Book project, but of course that was months ago, and I can't remember the process because I didn't write it down! So for myself and for everyone else, here I go!\n\nFirst, why did I choose [giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus)? I loved that it supported multiple languages (human languages because I sometimes blog about languages that don't use the Latin alphabet), it has some math notation ability, and it is open source and has a great github page. \n\n\n# Other fiddly things with Quarto Website\n\n## Deploy to Netlify\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html\n\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\n",
