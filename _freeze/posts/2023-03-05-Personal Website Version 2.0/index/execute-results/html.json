My blogdown project had accumulated so much code debris over the years because I started it when I was first learning to code, that it seemed easier to just take the posts and migrate them to a new Quarto Website + Blog than correcting all the mistakes accumulated over 4 years.\n\nThree things I wanted out of the new website:\n\n1) Make writing posts easy. Quarto does not have an add-in (yet) like Blogdown does to create a new blog post. So I leaned very, very heavily on [Mark Edney's R-Blogger's post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/08/creating-posts-for-quarto-blog/) on how to make a handy Shiny app to take the thinking out of setting up each blog post. The rough part of being just excited enough to blog, but with huge time constraints is that I might go months in between posting and inevitably forget things and it frustrates me. \n\n2) Have a website plus a blog so the Quarto Website + Blog was a great combo idea that I was able to execute with help from [a post by Samantha Csik.](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/)\n\n3) Enable discussions on my blog. I don't think I have much traffic on my blog, but I know a few people have used things I have written because when I was Googling myself I found someone thanking me in their blog post about something I had had to troubleshoot in my blog and of course then blogged about it.\n\n## Shiny App for Blog Post Creation\n\nFor setting up the Shiny App, the only major change I did was to make a multi-select option for categories for my blog post template from Mark's original work. This is nice because it helps me make sure I am not duplicating categories (eg Medicine and medicine) because categories are case sensitive. I also added a `data-modified` section to my template because I like to capture when I update a post.\n\nHere's the whole app below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Source https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/08/creating-posts-for-quarto-blog/\n#\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(miniUI)\n\nQGadget <- function() {....}\n\nui <- miniUI::miniPage(\n  miniUI::gadgetTitleBar(\"Quarto Blog Post\"),\n  miniUI::miniContentPanel(\n    shiny::textInput(\"title\", \"Title\", placeholder = \"Post Title\"),\n    shiny::selectInput(\"categories\", \"Categories\", \n                       choices = list(\"How-to\", \n                                      \"R\", \"Python\", \"Quarto\",\n                                      \"Medicine\", \n                                      \"Family Life\", \"Cooking\"),\n                       multiple = TRUE)\n\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  shiny::observeEvent(input$done, {\n    Blog_post(input$title, input$categories)\n    stopApp(\"Post Created\")\n  })\n}\n\nshiny::runGadget(ui, server, viewer = shiny::dialogViewer(\"Quarto Blog Post\"))\n\nBlog_post <- function(title, categories){\n  data <- list(title = title,\n               author = \"'Mara Alexeev'\",\n               date = Sys.Date(),\n               date_modified = \"'`r Sys.Date()`'\",\n               categories = categories,\n                 \n               draft = 'true',\n               description = \"''\",\n               image = \"''\",\n               archives = format(date, \"%Y/%m\"),\n               toc = 'false',\n               fold = \"true\",\n               tools = 'true',\n               link =  'false')\n  \n  Template <- '---\ntitle: {{title}}\nauthor: {{author}}\ndate: {{date}}\ndate-modified: {{date_modified}}\ncategories: [{{categories}}]\ndraft: {{draft}}\ndescription: {{description}}\nimage: {{image}}\narchives:\n  - {{archives}}\ntoc: {{toc}}\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: {{fold}}\n    code-tools: {{tools}}\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\n# Conclusion\n\n'\n  \n  dir.create(paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title))\n  writeLines(whisker::whisker.render(Template, data), paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title, \"/index.qmd\"))\n  file.edit(paste0(\"./posts/\",data$date, \"-\", title, \"/index.qmd\"))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\n",
