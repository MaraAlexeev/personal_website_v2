I typically do the rating before bed as I journal.\n\nI rate my status on these variables on a minus two to plus two scale. All variables have the same direction of 'goodness'. For example, plus two on the tiredness scale means I feel completely rested and have more than enough energy to do everything I wanted in a day, whereas minus two means I feel like I don't have enough energy to do the minimum amount of things needed to scrap by in a day. Plus two on the discomfort scale means my body feels amazing and I have no discomfort.\n\nI have plotted the 28 day rolling mean of the value ratings below.\n\nAs I write this blog, I am fairly shocked by a few parts of the plot. First, I do not remember feeling so happy or rested as the plot seems to indicate after the birth of my first child (June 2018). Also it seems a two week break in July 2022 from work outside the home had huge effect on all four variables for a fair amount of time afterwards. I plan to investigate what happened in Spring 2019 that was temporally related to a significant downward shift of all ratings. Without referring back to my journal, I recall that Spring being highly influenced by trying to re-enter the workforce.\n\nSome notable events are denoted with vertical lines on the plot:\n\n- June 2018: birth of first child\n- Sept 2019: return to work\n- March 2020: living apart from husband and son during pandemic for approximately 100 days\n- July 2020: start of fellowship\n- August 2020: birth of second child\n- July 2022: start of new job\n\nI think the most exciting part of finally seeing this data is now planning to try a few different interventions on myself for 4 week periods to see if I can see meaningful changes to my rolling mean in any of the four areas.\n\nAn aspect not well captured in these plots is my sense of meaning. I have a tremendous sense of meaning in my life since having children. While that might seem like an improvement, I want even more! The kicks just keep getting harder to get, and now I crave more meaning in my life: more engagement with friends, family, my local community. It's as if my children unlocked a new level of connection to the world and expanded my capacity to care about things I hadn't even noticed in my life before. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Combining it all\n\nI think the combination of discomfort, happiness, stress, and tiredness are some of the biggest indicators of what my overall mood would probably be. When I look at the four measures summed up, I see following trends. I remain impressed that the year after my first child was born, I was rating myself so highly in all four areas.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
